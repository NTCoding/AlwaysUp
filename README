A random-playlist shoutcast server written in Erlang as an OTP application.

To use this bad boy:

1. Put some songs in the root folder (AlwaysUp)

2. run make in root folder

4. In vlc media player (or other shoutcast player) open network stream at: http://localhost:3000

Keep an eye on the terminal for the output. It will notify you of:

- client connection received
- current song being streamed
- bytes being sent 
- when the end of a song has been reached
