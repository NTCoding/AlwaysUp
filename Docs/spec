Requirement
------------

Need to create a music streaming platform with no planned downtime. This includes
needed to fix bugs, add new features, and error scenarios.


Use Erlang Features
--------------------

Hot code loading:
		
	+ the system will develop a bug that needs to be fixed.
	  Using hot code loading, the bug will be fixed without any
	  downtime. All new requests will get the updated code,
	  whilst existing requests will not be interrupted and continue
	  to use the old code


Process Monitoring:

	+ When an error condition arises a system process will catch it
	  and ensure that the request will continue to be fulfilled by
	  a new process. This should demonstrate minimum, if any, disruption
	  to the client


Performance

	+ TBA


Scalability

	+ TBA


Demo
----

+ Demo the use of all Erlang features

+ Show the equivalent in .NET
	- is it possible to maintain the same level of uptime?
	- what would it take to maintain same level of uptime?
	- will existing requests be aborted or quality degraded

+ How every process is a server - not 1 server with multiple threads

+ OTP libararies


Plan 
-----

1. Streaming service that streams 1 song from file stream

2. Handles errors with minimal disruption to users

3. Implement a bug that can be fixed by hot code loading
	+ Gets halfway through a song and skips back to the start

4. Implement hot code loading that can be used to fix the bug

5. Use a cluster of nodes - 3 or 4 with a system process on another node
	+ look at patterns in Erlang book

5. Refactor to use the OTP libraries (but on a separate branch?)
